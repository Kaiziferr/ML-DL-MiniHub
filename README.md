# **🚀 ML-DL-MiniHub**

This repository is my personal space for exploration, experimentation, and continuous learning in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

Here, I build and document mini-projects focused on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and other AI techniques. Each project goes beyond simply applying algorithms — the goal is to deeply understand how they work, analyze their behavior, optimize their performance, and extract meaningful insights from data.

## Mini Projects 

### Machine Learning (ML) 🤖

#### Classification

**🛳 Titanic – Machine Learning**:  
Disaster Kaggle Titanic competition notebook implementing a Random Forest classifier with Out-of-Bag (OOB) score evaluation.

#### Regression

**💰 Chained Regression for Financial Payment Prediction**
Development of a chained regression approach to predict the total payments of a financial institution (synthetic data). The solution consists of three sequential models, where the predictions generated by each model are incorporated as input features for the subsequent model.

### Deep Learning (DL) 🧠

#### Classification

**🩺 Diabetes Detection**
Implementation and comparison of different fully connected neural network architectures for predicting diabetes within a population group.
