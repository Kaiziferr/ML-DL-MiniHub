# **ML-DL-MiniHub**

This project is my personal space for exploration and practice in the field of artificial intelligence, where I develop mini projects in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and other AI techniques. Each mini project aims not only to apply algorithms but also to understand their behavior, optimize their performance, and extract meaningful insights from the data. Through these exercises, I experiment with different model architectures, perform data preprocessing, evaluate metrics, and work on interpreting results.
